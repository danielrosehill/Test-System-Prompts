# Test-System-Prompts

This is a very small repository of different system prompts organized and curated specifically for the purpose of testing out specific functionalities in multimodal AI tools, particularly assistant and agent configuration platforms.

## Overview

The system prompts in this repository are organized according to the capability that they draw upon:

- **Audio**: Prompts for testing audio processing capabilities
- **Characters**: Prompts for testing personality and character emulation
- **Realtime Data Access**: Prompts for testing integration with current information
- **Research**: Prompts for testing information gathering and synthesis
- **Video**: Prompts for testing video analysis capabilities
- **Vision**: Prompts for testing image recognition and processing

## Purpose

This repository serves as a quick bench of configurations for conducting product evaluations of AI assistants and agent platforms. Each prompt is designed to test specific aspects of multimodal AI capabilities, making it easier to assess and compare different tools and implementations.
